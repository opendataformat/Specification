This section demonstrates how to generate data files in the Open Data Format (ODF) using Python. 
To generate ODF files metadata has to be stored in four CSV files following the 
specification of the internal Open Data Format. 


## Generating ODF from CSV

An easy way to generate data files in the Open Data Format is to go through
four CSV files in the Internal Open Data Format. This repository provides a
python script to generate an ODF zip-file from the four CSVs.
The advantage using this approach is that CSV files containing data and 
metadata can be easily generated by any data provider who has structured 
metadata in a machine-readable format.

The requirements and structure of the CSV files for generating ODF and 
examples can be found on GitLab.
